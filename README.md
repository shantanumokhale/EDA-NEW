It was established in 2005 as a U.S Department of Homeland Security Center of Excellence.
Apart from the city and the country, the dataset also specifies the latitude and longitude of the attacks thereby giving accurate locations that can help in data visualization. With the help of abundant features available in this dataset, we can find out the intensity of attacks by region for a particular year, whether there are any temporal or geographical trends in the attacks and the relationships between the characteristics of attacks and their success and failure rates.
